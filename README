# TemPl: A temporal mission planner for reconfigurable multi-robot systems

## Changelog

  - introduced symmetry breaking to role distribution:
    - limit on occurrences of individuals, i.e. how to deal with combination vs. permutation
     - compare role distribution solutions: how to limit --> use symmetry breaking
       - Lightweight Dynamic Symmetry Breaking (http://www.cmears.id.au/symmetry/)
        - see Chapter 8.10 in Gecode Modelling and Programming
v0.2 Prototype with basic layout of planning algorithm and (coarsely implemented) backtracking

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

The folder test/data/scenarios contains a set of missions that try to test
different aspects of the mission planner.

#### transterra-mission
- v0.3:
  All resources start at lander. Payload-items have to be moved to two further
  locations using mobile systems that are moving to these locations as well

## Further development
  - payload-items have to be moved to locations, where no system is initially
  moving towards
    -- feature-req: iterative repair, e.g., fix by adding a transport service requirement to
    this location if no initial solution can be found [ONGOING RESTRUCTURING OF SEARCH]
  - add CardinalityConstraints on functionality in order to allow for a quantification of the functionality -- e.g. for transport add a min capacity for payload transport or similar

  - allow for threading, i.e. start search per thread

  - use A* based search using the violations for a distance to a proper solution

  - compute safety metric (here: redundancy level) for individual transitions
    -- feature-req: compute metric with respect to the required functionality (along the
    timeline)
    -- howto: compute timeline per role --> compute sum of services --> compute
    metric along one the timeline with respect to this sum of services

  - strengthen individual transitions, i.e., improve metric by recipe
    -- feature-req: iterative planning, e.g., fix by adding a dedicated
    requirement (for a payload) to boost the redundancy
    -- check what contributes most to the metric with respect
       to the required functionality (along the timeline)

  - compute plans for individual systems
    -- feature-req: compute duration of activities, assign time bounds

  - identify critical path
